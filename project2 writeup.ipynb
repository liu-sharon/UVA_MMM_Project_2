This would mean that lower housing prices would lead to a dramatic decrease in wealth for homeowners. This decrease in wealth will lead to lower consumption spending. This decrease in consumption spending will lead to the local economies lagging, which therefore lead to an increase in unemployment.\n",
    "    This model, however, cannot be used for causal inference. Regressing unemployment as an outcome of housing price index would lead to biased coefficients and a false estimation of the true impact of housing price index on unemployment. The largest problem we would face if we ran this over-simplified regression would be that there is not random assignment for treatment and control groups. Typically, higher or lower housing prices are not randomly assigned, so there is the problem of endogeneity, and more specifically, omitted variable bias. There are a number of factors not included in that regression that would influence both housing prices and unemployment if we did not have random assignment. For example, poverty level, the general state of the economy (boom-bust cycle), and crime in a given county are all factors that would influence both housing prices and unemployment. However, these will be controlled for if we have random assignment.\n",

Ultimately, Y (output) and P (price) will decline as the market moves back towards equilibrium. As Y falls, the number of jobs will fall at the same time - if the economy is outputting less, there are fewer jobs. Therefore, this drop in output will ultimately lead to higher unemployment.

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> The strategy we used to identify causal impact presented similarities between Rubin's study. Both our strategies utilized the concept of direct and indirect causal effects. For our study, we determined unemployment to be the direct casual effect on housing prices, and also noted a number of indirect effects on the prices as well. These included retirement rates, level of education, and immigration levels. These indirect factors in fact had a domino effect on the housing prices as a whole. For instance, a large percentage of baby boomers failed to retire at the traditional retirement age in the mid-2000s. The effects of their decisions rippled down, with middle aged and other adults not rising in the ranks of industry as a result. Younger adults fresh out of college were less likely to find openings, and remained unemployed. This contributed to an increase in the unemployment rate on a large scale. Thus, this indirect effect ended up having a direct effect on unemployment. \n",

Rubin's study hit all of the necessary requirements for causation, and used random sampling throughout experimentation. Our empirical strategy only utilized data we already had access to, and was not a random sample. Thus, the strategy we used is theoretically not guaranteed to be unbiased and has a higher chance of being subject to other outside factors beyond our control and influencing the results. \n",
