The data available range from 2006 through 2017, however you should focus on the period known as the Great Recession. During this time, the volatile state of the economy generated considerable variation in housing prices and unemployment levels across the United States. Using this variation, you should attempt to identify a causal link between these two variables. Many demographic controls are available in the ACS data that you should consider including in your model. Your task is to determine the direction of causality."

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> Our empirical model states that housing price index is a factor in determining unemployment. Lower housing prices in a given county will lead to lower wealth for homeowners. Houses, as an asset, make up a dominant component of wealth for the majority of households in the United States. This would mean that lower housing prices would lead to a dramatic decrease in wealth for homeowners. This decrease in wealth will lead to lower consumption spending. This decrease in consumption spending will lead to a lag in the local economy, which therefore lead to an increase in unemployment.\n",
    "    This model, however, cannot be used for causal inference. Regressing unemployment as an outcome of housing price index would lead to biased coefficients and a false estimation of the true impact of housing price index on unemployment. The largest problem we would face if we ran this over-simplified regression would be that there is not random assignment for treatment and control groups. Typically, higher or lower housing prices are not randomly assigned, so there is the problem of endogeneity, and more specifically, omitted variable bias. There are a number of factors not included in that regression that would influence both housing prices and unemployment if we did not have random assignment. For example, poverty level, the general state of the economy (boom-bust cycle), and crime in a given county are all factors that would influence both housing prices and unemployment. However, these will be controlled for if we have random assignment of counties affected by the Great Recession and counties unaffected by the Great Recession. Of course, we cannot control for every possible endogenous variable with our given data, but with our quasi-randomization, we should get as close as possible.\n",

    "The empirical strategy we will utilize is making use of an interaction between the burst of the housing market bubble in 2008 and the change in housing price index of the specific counties. We will be using a difference-in-difference design, with the control group being counties with a near-zero change in the housing price index and the treatment group being counties with a larger change in the housing price index. Specifically, the treatment group is where the change in the housing price index between 2007 and 2008 is less than a 5% change in housing price index.  We will be comparing these two groups before and after the crash of the housing market.\n",
    "    When the housing market and housing prices collapsed in 2008, there was an extreme negative wealth effect on consumers, which lead to an inability to borrow. Since consumers are unable to borrow, there will be an inward shift of the investment supply curve. This will lead to an inward shift of the aggregate demand curve, due to the change in income. Ultimately, Y (output) and P (price) will decline as the market moves back towards equilibrium. As Y falls, the number of jobs will fall at the same time - if the economy is outputting less, there are fewer jobs. Therefore, this drop in output will ultimately lead to higher unemployment. We now have a quasi-random assignment of a change in housing prices, by comparing before vs. after the burst of the housing bubble. To control for other endogenous variables, we will be using counties with a near-zero (less than 5%) change in the housing price index as a proxy for counties that are relatively unaffected by the Great Recession. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> The strategy we used to identify causal impact presented similarities to Rubin's study. Both our strategies utilized the concept of direct and indirect causal effects. For our study, we determined housing prices to be a direct effect on unemployment, and also noted a number of indirect effects on unemployment as well. Some examples of these included poverty level and level of education. These indirect factors in fact ended up being used as part of our regression analysis, as part of controls in the difference-in-difference design. We used counties with a relatively unchanged level of housing price index as a proxy for counties that had been largely unaffected by the Great Recession. As explained before, our difference-in-difference utilized the interaction of before vs. after the housing market crashed and the amount of change in housing price index as the motivation behind our research design. \n",
    "    In addition, Rubin's study perceived outcomes as a function of the factors of causation. This is similar to how we constructed our analysis, with unemployment level a result of our regression involving multiple effects we believed to initiate a causality. However, differences were also present between our two strategies. Principles of scientific experiment suggest that true causation can only be used on a random sample. Rubin's study hit all of the necessary requirements for causation, and used random sampling throughout experimentation. Our empirical strategy only utilized data we already had access to, and was not a random sample. Our difference-in-difference research design attempted to get as close to quasi-randomization as possible, but of course was not completely randomized. Thus, the strategy we used is theoretically not guaranteed to be unbiased and has a higher chance of being subject to other outside factors beyond our control and influencing the results.\n",
